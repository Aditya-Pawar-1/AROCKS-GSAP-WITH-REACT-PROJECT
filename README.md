# AROCKS GSAP with React Project

## Overview

The **AROCKS GSAP with React Project** is a clone of the AROCKS website, where I have implemented the animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) in React. The project aims to replicate the look and feel of the original website while showcasing the smooth, interactive animations that GSAP is known for.

## Features

- **React Components**: Built with React to maintain a modular and reusable component structure.
- **GSAP Animations**: Implemented GSAP animations to create a rich, interactive user experience, including scroll animations, fade-ins, and movement effects.
- **Modern UI/UX**: The interface is designed to closely replicate the AROCKS website, giving it a clean and professional look.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Used for adding high-performance animations to the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling components.
